
This is a css library that contains a list of animation names from the animations used in css.
In order to use any of the library animations, you need to assign the class name of the wanted animation to the certain element.

Animations:
1. pulsate - gives a pulsating effect when hovered over (it constantly expands and decrease in a small time interval).
2. grow - when you hover over the element, it increases the size of the element, and when you move the mouse away it gradually turns back to its original state.
3. underline - As simple as the name explains, when the element is hovered it underlines it.
4. grow-rotate - As the element grows it rotates for 45deg, making a great visual effect.

Example of how to use the class animations:

<span class="grow"><h1>Stellar</h1</span>
